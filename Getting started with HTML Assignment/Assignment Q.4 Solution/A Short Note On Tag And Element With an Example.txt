Write a short note on tag and element with an example.

Ans:
Tag:
(1)An HTML tag is made up of letters, words, and numbers.It is a snippet of code enclosed within angular brackets("<" ">")
that defines the  the purpose and structure of a specific element on a webpage. Tags are used to instruct the web browser how to display the content they enclose. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with the name of the 
element enclosed within the tags.

Example: <h1> This is a h1 tag. </h1>

In this example, <h1> is the opening tag, and </h1> is the closing tag. The content "This is a h1 tag." is the 
text within the paragraph element.


Element:

(2)A combination of opening and closing tag along with some content between the two tags forms an element.
(3)An HTML element may be empty or can have some attributes to specify the additional formatting and publishing instuctions.

Example: <h1> This is a h1 tag. </h1>

In this example, <h1> is the opening tag, "This is a h1  tag." is the content, and </h1> is the closing tag. 
Together, they form the complete <h1> element, representing a heading.
