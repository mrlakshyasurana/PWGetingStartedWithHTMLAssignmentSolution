Comments allow you to provide additional information in the HTML code. The comments are not meant to be displayed. That is no one can see the comments unless they look at the HTML source code. To add a comment we use '<!--' and '-->' tags. The '<!--' tag  represents beginning of comment while the '-->" tag represents end of comment. Comments are also referred as prologue. One example of comment is <!-- This is a comment -->.
